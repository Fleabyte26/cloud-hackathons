# Intro to GKE: Deploy, Scale and Update

## Introduction

Welcome to the coach's guide for the Intro to GKE gHack. Here you will find links to specific guidance for coaches for each of the challenges.

> **Note** If you are a gHacks participant, this is the answer guide. Don't cheat yourself by looking at this guide during the hack!

## Coach's Guides

- Challenge 1: Provision a GKE Cluster
   - Create a new GKE cluster that you'll use to deploy, scale and update your application
- Challenge 2: Containerizing your Application
   - Run your application in a stand alone fashion and then containerize it to prepare it for deployment to GKE
- Challenge 3: Deploy and Expose the Application
   - Using your containerized app in Artifact Registry, deploy it to GKE and expose it to the public internet
- Challenge 4: Scale the Application to Handle Increased Traffic
   - Now that the application is deployed and out there, we've noticed an increase in traffic and need to scale out to handle the new load
- Challenge 5: Update and Release with Zero Downtime
   - Change is inevitable, but new releases need to be deployed smoothly. Here we learn how to do that with zero downtime

## Coach Prerequisites

This hack has pre-reqs that a coach is responsible for understanding and/or setting up BEFORE hosting an event. Please review the [gHacks Hosting Guide](https://ghacks.dev/faq/howto-host-hack.html) for information on how to host a hack event.

The guide covers the common preparation steps a coach needs to do before any gHacks event, including how to properly setup Google Meet and Chat Spaces.

### Student Resources

Before the hack, it is the Coach's responsibility create and make available needed resources including: 
- Files for students
- Terraform scripts for setup (if running this gHack in a customer's environment)

Follow [these instructions](https://ghacks.dev/faq/howto-host-hack.html#making-resources-available) to create the zip files needed and upload them to your gHack's Google Space's Files area. 

Always refer students to the [gHacks website](https://ghacks.dev) for the student guide: [https://ghacks.dev](https://ghacks.dev)
