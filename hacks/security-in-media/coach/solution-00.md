## Notes & Guidance

If you are running this hack in an Argolis environment there are a few important things to keep in mind:

- The `default` network isn't automatically created. Students will be instructed to create a default network with auto-subnet creation turned on at the start of the hack.
- There are some default Argolis policies that will need to be changed to allow traffic through to the load balancer. Run the `argolis-fix-policy-defaults.sh` script in [this repository](https://github.com/gfilicetti/gcp-scripts) to set all the proper defaults.
