# Challenge 2: If it isn’t in version control, it doesn’t exist

[< Previous Challenge](challenge-01.md) - **[Home](../README.md)** - [Next Challenge >](challenge-03.md)

## Introduction

The objective of this challenge is to create and configure a Git repository so that the code can be version controlled. You could use any external Git repository (Github/BitBucket/Gitlab etc) but the easiest way for this challenge is to use a Cloud Source Repository on GCP.

## Description

If you have completed the previous challenge, you should have the source code already unpacked on your Managed Notebook. But you’re free to complete this challenge on another environment such as Cloud Shell or your local machine.

Create a Cloud Source Repository, configure access through SSH.

Make sure that the source code is pushed to the freshly created repository and can be cloned from it.

## Success Criteria

1. There’s a new Cloud Source Repository 
2. The code base is pushed to Cloud Source Repository
3. At least one team member can access the repository from the command line
4. No code changes are needed for this challenge

## Tips

- You already have a terminal available on the notebook that you’ve created as part of the previous challenge. That terminal has all the tools you need to complete this challenge.
