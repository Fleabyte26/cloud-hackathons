# Implementing MLOps on GCP

## Introduction

We'll be assuming that all necessary services have been enabled and the (default) service accounts have the right permissions. You can use the provided `Terraform` scripts to set up things properly if you're not using Qwiklabs.

> Qwiklabs: for every team only a single person needs to start the lab. A single lab instance provides 5 users with _Owner_ permissions so people can work in parallel. The person starting the lab can share the usernames & passwords for the team members.
