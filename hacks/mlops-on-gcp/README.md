# Implementing MLOps on GCP

## Introduction

In this hack, you’ll implement the full lifecycle of an ML project. We’ll provide you with a sample code base and you’ll work on automating continuous integration (CI), continuous delivery (CD), and continuous training (CT) for a machine learning (ML) system.

## Learning Objectives

This hack will help you explore the following tasks:

- Using Cloud Source Repositories for version control
- Using Cloud Build for automating continuous integration and delivery
- Vertex AI for 
  - Exploration through an interactive environment
  - Training on diverse hardware 
  - Model registration
  - Managed pipelines
  - Model serving
  - Model monitoring

> The instructions are minimal, meaning that you need to figure out things :) That's by design

## Challenges

- Challenge 1: [Let’s start exploring!](student/challenge-01.md)
- Challenge 2: [If it isn’t in version control, it doesn’t exist](student/challenge-02.md)
- Challenge 3: [You break the build, you buy cake](student/challenge-03.md)
- Challenge 4: [Automagic training with pipelines](student/challenge-04.md)
- Challenge 5: [Make it work and make it scale](student/challenge-05.md)
- Challenge 6: [Monitor your models](student/challenge-06.md)
- Challenge 7: [Close the loop](student/challenge-07.md)
