# gHacks - Retail Analytics
## Introduction
Welcome to the coach's guide for the Retail Analytics gHack. Here you will find links to specific guidance for coaches for each of the challenges.

Remember that this hack includes a optional [lecture presentation](Lectures.pdf) that features short presentations to introduce key topics associated with each challenge. It is recommended that the host present each short presentation before attendees kick off that challenge.
